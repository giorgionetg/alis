<img src="/imgs/alis-small-square.png" alt="Alis Mardare"  class="w-full lg:w-30 lg:m-0 lg:mr-4 float-left rounded-lg shadow" /> There’s a thread that connects the fertile fields of my homeland with the negotiations in international markets:

 **a deep passion for building bridges between those who produce and those who seek authentic quality**.  

For over **18 years I have been working in the agricultural sector**, gaining solid expertise in fertilizers and long-term commercial relationships. Today, I’ve chosen to put this experience at the service of a new challenge: **bringing carefully selected fresh produce to the European market, with a special focus on Egyptian artichokes and other Mediterranean specialties**.  

My goal is clear: **to connect reliable producers with demanding distributors and buyers**, ensuring quality, transparency, and consistency. I believe that true success is built on mutual trust, respect for timing, and the ability to understand the real needs of all parties.  

**Alis Mardare** is more than just a name — it’s a commitment: to enhance what the land gives us and to build long-lasting business relationships, where every deal becomes a sustainable partnership.  

If this vision resonates with you and you are interested in exploring potential collaboration, I will be glad to connect and start a concrete conversation.
